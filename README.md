## How it works
This mod is made using mixin to inject code inside the minecraft source code. The main usage of this is to change the projection matrix of the game from a perpective matrix to an isometric projection. This was inspired by what have been made in the immsersive portals mod.

## How to install
It's a forge mod so you just have to put the jar file from the release section in your mods folder.
Currently there is no fabric support.
